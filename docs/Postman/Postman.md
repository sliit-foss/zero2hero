## Reaction Codes 

When testing APIs with Postman, we generally get distinctive reaction codes. The absolute most normal include: 

100 Series > Temporal reactions, for instance, '102 Processing'.

## Conditions 

Postman additionally permits us to establish various conditions through the age/utilization of factors. For instance, a URL variable that is pointed towards various test conditions (dev-QA), empowering us to execute tests in various conditions utilizing existing solicitations.

## Conclusion

Mailman is an application that permits us to test APIs using a graphical UI. 
A portion of Postman's benefits incorporates the assortment highlight and the likelihood to establish diverse testing conditions. 
Mailman is an easy-to-use apparatus that assists us with improving our time when executing tests.
