# Machine Learning vs AI vs Deep Learning vs Neural Networks

When we talk about machine learning or AI there are few words coming in.

- AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- ML (Machine Learning)
- Neural Networks
- Deep Learning

Even though they all look similar they are not. For simply put, Deep learning is Subset of Neural Networks and Neural networks are subnet of ML. ML is subset of AI. Deep learning makes the backbone of the Neural networks.

## AI

So first lets see what is AI.

Simply AI is something that system or machine that can simulate the human brain processes.

To be an AI it is not required to be a very complex code train with large set of data. Even simple algorithms can act as AI. In next articles lets make some simple AIs without using any ML.

For example if we take a chess game, back then it was all hardcoded lines of codes. Computer only do execute those set of rules and follow instructions. So there were no algorithms or something. Like in this position do this. But later algorithm were developed and ML also.

For another example if we take Pac-Man Game the ghost are trying to catch the player. So simply it will somehow figure it out way to track the player and simulate that. In here ghost is working as AI. Even if there is no ML or Deep learning it still manages to do very good job with Algorithms

## Machine Learning

Simply what machine learning to do is it uses data and algorithms to imitate the human actions or processes in a way that human learns and gradually improving accuracy.

In traditional programming what we do is, we give data, then we give code (some rules) then computer will do some computations and result an output.

But in Machine learning, we give data, but this time we give answers with it. So the computer will make its rules and do the work. In most of the cases these models don't have 100% accuracy. So our goal is to train our module to get the highest possible accuracy.

(If you observed the image there are two part in Machine learning section. Simply in first computer will be given sample data and their result to get the module. Then the module is given to computer with test data (new data) to do the prediction.)


## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data.

So it is set of layers that input some data and output some result.

In neural networks there are three main layers

-  Input Layer
- Hidden Layers
- Output Layer

Input layer can get one or more input and transfer that data tot Hidden layers.

In hidden layers there can be one or more layers. This hidden layers consists of hidden unit which we called as nodes. (Represented in circles). Having more nodes and more layers allow Neural networks to do more calculations.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is formed with using neutral networks. Neural networks are the backbone of the deep learning.

If a network has at least 3 layer including input and output layers then it can consider as a deep learning, but there are some differences in them which we will discuss later.

In next articles let's take each one of these and discuss.
